Blueprint 2018 Project

This application was designed during the 2018 Blueprint Hackathon at MITs campus. 
It was designed primarily to allow for seamlessly sharing social media. Using one application as the root of multiple social media accounts,
users could share desired accounts with new and old friends alike with a simplistic QR Code and built in QR Scanner.

We are very proud to have produced this application in a twenty-four hour timeframe and hope to
continue to add to this project at a later date.
